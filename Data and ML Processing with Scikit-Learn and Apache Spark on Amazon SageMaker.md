***Data and ML Processing with Scikit-Learn and Apache Spark on Amazon SageMaker***

## Introduction

Data processing is an essential step to developing resilient, reusable, and reliable Machine Learning (ML) pipelines.  ***Amazon Web Services*** provides specific services for performing many data and ML processing tasks.  ***Amazon SageMaker*** is a ML service designed to build, train, and deploy ML models across the entire ML lifecycle. ***Scikit-Learn***  a.k.a SKLearn is a Python ML library designed to perform a plethora of data science duties for statistics, feature engineering, supervised learning, and unsupervised learning. ***Apache Spark*** is a distributed computing big data analytics framework designed to transform, engineer, and process massive amounts of data (think terabytes and petabytes) across a cluster of machines.  Spark contains many data engineering and data science interfaces such as Spark SQL, Spark Structured Streaming, and Spark ML.  Both SKLearn and Spark are fully supported and integrated within the ***SageMaker Python SDK*** hence providing the ability to deploy SKLearn/Spark code via ***Amazon SageMaker Processing***.  SageMaker Processing is an internal platform feature specialized to run various types of data and ML transformations (i.e. pre-processing & post-porcessing).  For example, feature engineering, as well as, generating training, validation, and test sets for data validation and model evaluation. 

Here is official **Amazon SageMaker Processing Documentation** on all current available features (https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/amazon_sagemaker_processing.html, https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/processing-job.html).
